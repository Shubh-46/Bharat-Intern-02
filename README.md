Machine Learning model to predict the different species of flowers on the length of there petals and sepals.
**Iris Flower Classification**
**Overview**
This project demonstrates the implementation of a classic machine learning task: classifying iris flowers into three species based on their features. The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community and is often used for introductory classification tasks.

**Getting Started**
To get started with this project, follow the steps below.

**Prerequisites**
Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-Learn
You can install these libraries using pip:
                code-pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
                
**Dataset**
For this project, we have used the Iris dataset, which is included with scikit-learn. The dataset contains four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and the corresponding target labels (setosa, versicolor, virginica).

**Usage**
You can use the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository to run the code step-by-step and understand how the classification model works.
                code- jupyter notebook iris_classification.ipynb
                
**Model Training**
The core of this project is the classification model. We have used various algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classification. You can find the code for model training in the Jupyter Notebook. You can customize and fine-tune the model as needed.

**Evaluation**
We have included evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance. These metrics are explained in the Jupyter Notebook.

**Results**
The project provides insights into how well the classification model predicts the species of iris flowers based on their features. You can visualize the results and understand the relationships between input features and predicted labels.
